 * Role-based access for staff at schools, publishers and SchoolShop itself.

 * Each organisation type has a fixed set of permissions and built-in roles
 * that bundle them. The API sends each membership's role and permissions at
 * sign-in (and on /me/), and enforces them on every request; the app uses the
 * same table to hide what a role can't open and explain why.
